# SQL Data Analytics — Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of **SQL scripts** designed for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.  
The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to derive insights, calculate key performance metrics, and support business intelligence workflows.

---

##  Overview

These scripts cover multiple analytical themes, such as:

- **Database exploration** – understanding table relationships, dimensions, and measures  
- **Metric calculations** – building KPIs and key measures  
- **Time-based trends** – analyzing changes over time  
- **Cumulative analytics** – understanding running totals and growth trends  
- **Segmentation** – dividing customers, products, or orders into categories  
- **Performance analysis** – identifying top performers  
- **Reporting** – creating reusable report queries for dashboards and BI tools  

Each script is modular and demonstrates **best practices in SQL** for data analysts and BI professionals.

##  Key Learning Goals

- Practice writing **analytical SQL queries** using real-world business examples  
- Learn to structure SQL projects into **exploration, analysis, and reporting** phases  
- Develop a mindset for **data storytelling through SQL**  
- Understand how to prepare SQL reports for integration with **Power BI** or similar tools

##  Technologies

- **SQL Server / T-SQL**
- **Relational Database Modeling**
- **Power BI (for visualization)**

##  Example Reports

- **Customer Report** → `11_report_customers.sql`  
- **Product Report** → `12_report_products.sql`  

Each report consolidates metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, customer count, and product performance.
